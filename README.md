# AirFrame

AirFrame is a program that allows the user to autonomously move a drone by following their face and perfectly framing it within the center to capture photos and videos. It uses Python and OpenCV along with the haar cascade algorithm to detect faces and have the drone follow it. This project was made using the DJI Ryze Tello Python API to remotely control the drone.

# AirFrame

AirFrame allows users to autonomously move a drone by following their faces and perfectly framing them within the center when capturing photos and videos. It uses Python and OpenCV along with the haar cascade algorithm to detect faces and have the drone follow it. This project was made using the DJI Ryze Tello Python API to remotely control the drone.

# What I Learned

* Autonomous drone controls using external APIs and Python
* OpenCV face detection
* Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) control for drones

# Sample Video
